# Type Compatibility in TypeScript

Type compatibility in TypeScript is based on **structural typing**, also known as **duck typing**. This means that two types are compatible if their structures (properties and methods) match, regardless of their explicit type names. Unlike nominal typing (used in languages like Java or C#), where compatibility is determined by explicit type declarations, TypeScript focuses on **shape matching**.

## **Structural Typing Example**

Consider the following example:

```typescript
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

let p1: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
let p2: { x: number; y: number } = p1;

console.log(p2.x); // Output: 10
```

### **Explanation**

- `p1` is of type `Point`.
- `p2` has an inline type `{ x: number; y: number }`, which matches the structure of `Point`.
- Since both have the same properties (`x` and `y` with the same types), TypeScript considers them **compatible**, allowing `p1` to be assigned to `p2`.

---

## **Rules of Type Compatibility**

TypeScript follows a set of rules to determine whether one type is assignable to another:

### **1. Object Type Compatibility**

An object type `A` is assignable to an object type `B` if `A` has all properties of `B` with compatible types.

#### **Example**

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Employee {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}

let emp: Employee = { name: "Alice", id: 101 };
let person: Person = emp; // ✅ Compatible

console.log(person.name); // Output: "Alice"
```

Here, `Employee` has all the properties required by `Person`, so the assignment is valid.

However, the reverse is **not** allowed:

```typescript
let p: Person = { name: "Bob" };
let e: Employee = p; // ❌ Error: Property 'id' is missing
```

Since `p` does not have the `id` property, TypeScript does not consider it compatible with `Employee`.

---

### **2. Function Type Compatibility**

Function compatibility follows the **contravariant** rule for parameters and **covariant** rule for return types.

#### **Parameter Compatibility**

A function `A` is assignable to function `B` if `A`’s parameters are **less restrictive** than `B`’s.

```typescript
type Func1 = (x: number) => void;
type Func2 = (x: number, y: string) => void;

let f1: Func1;
let f2: Func2;

f1 = f2; // ❌ Error: f2 expects an extra parameter (y)
f2 = f1; // ✅ Allowed: f1 can be used where f2 is expected (extra params are ignored)
```

#### **Return Type Compatibility**

A function `A` is assignable to function `B` if `A`'s return type is **a subtype of** `B`'s return type.

```typescript
type ReturnA = () => string;
type ReturnB = () => string | number;

let ra: ReturnA = () => "Hello";
let rb: ReturnB = ra; // ✅ Allowed (string is a subtype of string | number)
```

---

### **3. Class Compatibility**

Classes follow structural typing as well, but they also include **private** and **protected** members.

#### **Example**

```typescript
class Animal {
  name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Dog {
  name: string;
  breed: string;
  constructor(name: string, breed: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
  }
}

let a: Animal = new Dog("Buddy", "Labrador"); // ✅ Allowed: Dog has all properties of Animal
let d: Dog = new Animal("Max"); // ❌ Error: Missing 'breed' property
```

However, if a class has `private` members, it **must** come from the same class to be assignable:

```typescript
class Parent {
  private secret: string = "hidden";
}

class Child extends Parent {}

let p = new Parent();
let c = new Child();

// let p2: Parent = c; // ✅ Allowed (Child extends Parent)
// let c2: Child = p;  // ❌ Error: Parent and Child are not structurally identical due to 'private' members
```

---

### **4. Generics Compatibility**

Generics follow the same structural compatibility rules.

#### **Example**

```typescript
interface Box<T> {
  value: T;
}

let numberBox: Box<number> = { value: 10 };
let stringBox: Box<string> = { value: "Hello" };

// numberBox = stringBox; // ❌ Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```

However, if the generic type does not affect the structure, it is still compatible:

```typescript
interface Container<T> {
  size: number;
}

let c1: Container<number> = { size: 5 };
let c2: Container<string> = { size: 10 };

c1 = c2; // ✅ Allowed: 'size' has the same type in both cases
```

---

### **5. Enum Compatibility**

Enums are only compatible with numbers by default:

```typescript
enum Status {
  Active,
  Inactive,
}

let s: Status = Status.Active;
let num: number = s; // ✅ Allowed

let s2: Status = num; // ✅ Allowed
```

However, different enums are **not** compatible:

```typescript
enum Role {
  Admin,
  User,
}

let r: Role = Status.Active; // ❌ Error: Different enum types
```

---

## **Conclusion**

TypeScript’s **structural typing** system ensures that types are compatible based on their **shape**, not their names. This makes TypeScript flexible but also enforces strict correctness in function parameters, return values, class members, and generics.
