# 1. `React.Memo()` :

`React.memo` is a higher-order component (HOC) provided by React that is used to optimize the rendering performance of functional components. It does this by memoizing the component, which means it will only re-render the component if its props have changed. This can be particularly useful in preventing unnecessary re-renders and improving the performance of your React application, especially when dealing with complex or frequently updating components.

### How `React.memo` Works

1. **Memoization**: When you wrap a functional component with `React.memo`, React will store a memoized version of the component. This means that React will remember the rendered output of the component and reuse it if the props haven't changed.

2. **Props Comparison**: By default, `React.memo` performs a shallow comparison of the props. If the props are the same (i.e., no changes are detected), React will skip re-rendering the component and reuse the last rendered output. If the props have changed, the component will re-render.

3. **Custom Comparison Function**: You can also provide a custom comparison function as the second argument to `React.memo` if you need more control over when the component should re-render. This function takes the previous props and the next props as arguments and should return `true` if the props are considered equal (i.e., no re-render is needed) and `false` otherwise.

### Syntax

```jsx
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  /* render using props */
}, arePropsEqual?);
```

- **`MyComponent`**: The functional component you want to memoize.
- **`arePropsEqual` (optional)**: A custom comparison function that determines whether the component should re-render based on the previous and next props.

### Example

#### Basic Usage

```jsx
import React from "react";

const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  console.log("Rendering MyComponent");
  return <div>{props.value}</div>;
});

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <MyComponent value="Hello, World!" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, `MyComponent` will only re-render if the `value` prop changes. Since the `value` prop is always `"Hello, World!"`, `MyComponent` will not re-render when the `count` state changes in the `App` component.

#### Custom Comparison Function

```jsx
import React from "react";

const MyComponent = React.memo(
  function MyComponent(props) {
    console.log("Rendering MyComponent");
    return <div>{props.value}</div>;
  },
  (prevProps, nextProps) => {
    // Only re-render if the length of the value string changes
    return prevProps.value.length === nextProps.value.length;
  }
);

function App() {
  const [text, setText] = React.useState("Hello");

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <MyComponent value={text} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, `MyComponent` will only re-render if the length of the `value` prop changes. If the length remains the same, even if the content of the string changes, the component will not re-render.

### When to Use `React.memo`

- **Expensive Rendering**: Use `React.memo` when the component has a costly rendering process and you want to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Stable Props**: Use `React.memo` when the component receives props that don't change often.
- **Pure Components**: Use `React.memo` for components that are primarily dependent on their props and should behave like pure functions.

### When Not to Use `React.memo`

- **Frequently Changing Props**: If the props change frequently, the overhead of comparing props might outweigh the benefits of memoization.
- **Simple Components**: For very simple components, the performance gain from using `React.memo` might be negligible.
- **Components with Side Effects**: If the component relies on side effects or context, `React.memo` might not be appropriate since it only compares props.

### Conclusion

`React.memo` is a powerful tool for optimizing the performance of functional components by preventing unnecessary re-renders. By memoizing the component and only re-rendering when the props change, you can improve the efficiency of your React application. However, it's important to use `React.memo` judiciously, as it may not always provide a performance benefit and can introduce complexity in some cases.

# 2. `useMemo()` Hooks :

`useMemo` is a React hook that **memoizes** (caches) the result of a computation. It is used to optimize performance by avoiding expensive recalculations on every render. Instead, the computation is only performed when one of its dependencies changes.

### How does `useMemo` work?

`useMemo` takes two arguments:

1. A **function** that performs the computation.
2. An **array of dependencies**. The computation will only be re-run when one of these dependencies changes.

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(
  () => computeExpensiveValue(dep1, dep2),
  [dep1, dep2]
);
```

- If the dependencies (`dep1`, `dep2`) remain the same between renders, `useMemo` will return the cached value.
- If the dependencies change, the function will re-run, and the new result will be cached.

---

### When should you use `useMemo`?

`useMemo` is useful in the following scenarios:

1. **Expensive Calculations**:

   - When you have a computationally expensive function (e.g., factorial, sorting, filtering large arrays) that doesn’t need to run on every render.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   const factorial = useMemo(() => computeFactorial(count), [count]);
   ```

2. **Referential Equality**:

   - When you want to ensure that an object or array has the same reference between renders, unless its dependencies change. This is useful when passing props to child components or using `useEffect` with dependencies.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   const user = useMemo(() => ({ name: "John", age: 30 }), []);
   ```

3. **Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders**:

   - When you want to prevent child components from re-rendering unnecessarily because their props haven’t changed.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   const memoizedData = useMemo(() => processData(data), [data]);
   return <ChildComponent data={memoizedData} />;
   ```

---

### Actual Use Cases of `useMemo`

#### 1. **Factorial Calculation**

- Avoid recalculating the factorial on every render unless the input changes.

```javascript
const factorial = useMemo(() => {
  console.log("Calculating factorial...");
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
    result *= i;
  }
  return result;
}, [count]);
```

#### 2. **Filtering or Sorting Large Lists**

- Avoid re-filtering or re-sorting a large list unless the list or filter criteria change.

```javascript
const filteredList = useMemo(() => {
  console.log("Filtering list...");
  return largeList.filter((item) => item.includes(searchTerm));
}, [largeList, searchTerm]);
```

#### 3. **Referential Equality in Objects or Arrays**

- Ensure that an object or array has the same reference between renders, unless its dependencies change.

```javascript
const user = useMemo(() => ({ name: "Alice", age: 25 }), []);
```

#### 4. **Optimizing Child Component Re-renders**

- Prevent a child component from re-rendering unnecessarily by memoizing the props passed to it.

```javascript
const memoizedData = useMemo(() => processData(data), [data]);
return <ChildComponent data={memoizedData} />;
```

---

### When **NOT** to use `useMemo`

1. **Simple Calculations**:

   - If the computation is cheap, using `useMemo` might add unnecessary overhead.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   const sum = a + b; // No need for useMemo
   ```

2. **Overusing for Referential Equality**:

   - If the object or array is small and re-created frequently, the performance gain might not justify the complexity.

3. **Premature Optimization**:
   - Avoid using `useMemo` unless you have identified a performance bottleneck. Overusing it can make the code harder to read and maintain.

---

### Example: Full Usage of `useMemo`

```javascript
import { useState, useMemo } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(5);
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");

  // Expensive computation: Factorial
  const factorial = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Calculating factorial...");
    let result = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
      result *= i;
    }
    return result;
  }, [count]);

  // Filtering a list
  const items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"];
  const filteredItems = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Filtering items...");
    return items.filter((item) => item.includes(searchTerm));
  }, [items, searchTerm]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>useMemo Example</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Factorial: {factorial}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>

      <input
        type="text"
        value={searchTerm}
        onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />
      <ul>
        {filteredItems.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### Key Takeaways:

- **Purpose**: `useMemo` is used to optimize performance by memoizing expensive computations or ensuring referential equality.
- **Dependencies**: Always specify the correct dependencies to avoid bugs or unnecessary recalculations.
- **Use Sparingly**: Only use `useMemo` when you have a clear performance issue. Overusing it can make the code harder to maintain.

# 3. `useCallback()` Hook :

`useCallback` is a React hook that is used to memoize functions, preventing them from being recreated on every render. This can be particularly useful for optimizing performance in scenarios where passing callbacks to child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Why Use `useCallback`?

In React, functions are recreated on every render by default. This means that if you pass a function as a prop to a child component, the child component will see it as a new function on every render, even if the function's logic hasn't changed. This can lead to unnecessary re-renders of the child component, especially if it is optimized with `React.memo` or relies on reference equality for performance optimizations.

`useCallback` helps to avoid this by returning a memoized version of the callback function that only changes when one of its dependencies changes.

### Syntax

```jsx
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // Function logic
}, [dependencies]);
```

- **`memoizedCallback`**: The memoized version of the callback function.
- **`dependencies`**: An array of values that the function depends on. The function will only be recreated if any of these values change.

### Example

#### Basic Usage

```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

const ChildComponent = React.memo(function ChildComponent({ onClick }) {
  console.log("ChildComponent rendered");
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
});

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, `handleClick` is a memoized callback created using `useCallback`. The `ChildComponent` is wrapped in `React.memo`, so it will only re-render if its props change. Because `handleClick` is memoized, it will not change between renders, and thus `ChildComponent` will not re-render unnecessarily.

#### With Dependencies

```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

const ChildComponent = React.memo(function ChildComponent({ onClick, value }) {
  console.log("ChildComponent rendered");
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{value}</button>;
});

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState("Hello");

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} value={text} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, `handleClick` depends on the `count` state. The callback will be recreated only when `count` changes. If `text` changes, `handleClick` will remain the same, preventing unnecessary re-renders of `ChildComponent`.

### When to Use `useCallback`

- **Passing Callbacks to Optimized Child Components**: Use `useCallback` when passing callbacks to child components that are optimized with `React.memo` or rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Expensive Computations**: Use `useCallback` when the function involves expensive computations and you want to avoid recreating it on every render.
- **Dependencies**: Use `useCallback` when the function depends on certain values (e.g., state or props) and you want to control when it should be recreated.

### When Not to Use `useCallback`

- **Simple Components**: For very simple components or functions, the overhead of using `useCallback` might outweigh the benefits.
- **No Performance Issues**: If you don't have performance issues related to unnecessary re-renders, you might not need `useCallback`.
- **Frequent Dependency Changes**: If the dependencies of the callback change frequently, `useCallback` might not provide significant performance benefits.

### Conclusion

`useCallback` is a useful hook for optimizing the performance of your React application by memoizing callback functions. It helps to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components and can be particularly beneficial when dealing with expensive computations or optimized components. However, it's important to use `useCallback` judiciously, as it may not always provide a performance benefit and can introduce complexity in some cases.
