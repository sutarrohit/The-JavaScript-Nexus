# **React Component Lifecycle**

In React, **components** have a **lifecycle** which can be divided into three main phases:

1. **Mounting**
2. **Updating**
3. **Unmounting**

Each phase has specific lifecycle methods that are triggered at various points during the component's existence. However, with the introduction of **React Hooks**, it's recommended to use the `useEffect` hook in functional components instead of manually handling lifecycle methods. Let's explore the lifecycle phases and their methods.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Mounting Phase**

When a component is being created and inserted into the DOM for the first time, it's in the **Mounting Phase**. This phase consists of the following methods:

### **üìå `constructor()`**

- The **constructor** is called first, before anything else.
- Used for setting up the initial state and binding event handlers.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }
  render() {
    return <div>{this.state.count}</div>;
  }
}
```

### **üìå `getDerivedStateFromProps()`**

- **Static method** that is called before every render, when the component's state or props change.
- Can be used to **derive state from props**.

```jsx
static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, nextState) {
  if (nextProps.value !== nextState.value) {
    return { value: nextProps.value };
  }
  return null;
}
```

üîπ This method is called **before rendering**.

### **üìå `render()`**

- The **`render` method** is the only required method in a class component.
- It returns the JSX (UI) that React should render.

```jsx
render() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

### **üìå `componentDidMount()`**

- This method is called **once** after the component has mounted (inserted into the DOM).
- It's often used for **fetching data** or interacting with external systems like APIs.

```jsx
componentDidMount() {
  console.log("Component has mounted!");
}
```

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Updating Phase**

The **Updating Phase** occurs when a component is being re-rendered due to **state or props changes**. The following methods are part of the update phase:

### **üìå `getDerivedStateFromProps()`** (Again)

This method is also called during the **updating phase** when props change.

### **üìå `shouldComponentUpdate()`**

- Determines if a component should **re-render** based on changes to props or state.
- It returns a **boolean** (`true` to re-render, `false` to skip).

```jsx
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
  return nextProps.someValue !== this.props.someValue;
}
```

### **üìå `render()`**

As mentioned earlier, the **`render()` method** is called every time the component's state or props change. It returns the updated UI.

### **üìå `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`**

- Called right before the **DOM is updated**.
- Useful for capturing information (like scroll position) before changes.

```jsx
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
  return { prevScrollPos: document.body.scrollTop };
}
```

### **üìå `componentDidUpdate()`**

- This method is called **after the component has updated**.
- It's used for operations like **DOM updates**, **network requests**, or **re-fetching data** after state/props change.

```jsx
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
  console.log("Component updated", prevProps, prevState);
}
```

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Unmounting Phase**

The **Unmounting Phase** occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM.

### **üìå `componentWillUnmount()`**

- This method is called **right before the component is removed** from the DOM.
- Commonly used for **cleanup**, such as removing event listeners or canceling network requests.

```jsx
componentWillUnmount() {
  console.log("Component will unmount!");
}
```

## **React Hooks & Lifecycle Methods in Functional Components**

Since **React 16.8**, functional components can use hooks to mimic lifecycle behavior. The **`useEffect`** hook is the main tool for handling side effects in functional components.

### **üìå Using `useEffect` for Component Lifecycle**

The **`useEffect` hook** allows us to run side effects, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or cleaning up resources.

#### **Mounting & Updating**

```jsx
useEffect(
  () => {
    // Code to run when component mounts or updates
    console.log("Component mounted or updated");

    // Cleanup function (similar to componentWillUnmount)
    return () => {
      console.log("Cleanup on unmount");
    };
  },
  [
    /* Dependency array */
  ]
); // If empty, runs only once on mount.
```

#### **Mounting Only (`componentDidMount`)**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted");

  return () => {
    console.log("Cleanup on unmount");
  };
}, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs only once on mount
```

#### **Updating (`componentDidUpdate`)**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component updated");
}, [someStateOrProps]); // Runs when `someStateOrProps` changes
```

#### **Unmounting (`componentWillUnmount`)**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    console.log("Cleanup on unmount");
  };
}, []); // Empty array to run cleanup only when unmounting
```

## **Final Thoughts**

React components have a lifecycle that helps manage **state changes**, **side effects**, and **cleanup** at the right time. Although lifecycle methods were commonly used in class components, **React Hooks** now provide a cleaner and more powerful way to handle lifecycle-like behavior in functional components using the `useEffect` hook.

### **Remember**:

- **`useEffect`** is the go-to for side effects in **functional components**.
- Lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` are mainly used in **class components**.
