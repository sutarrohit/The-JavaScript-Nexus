### **Render Props in React – A Detailed Explanation**

#### **What is a Render Prop?**

In React, a **render prop** is a technique for sharing logic between components using a **prop whose value is a function**. Instead of hardcoding behavior inside a component, you allow the parent component to pass a function that determines what to render.

This approach enables better **reusability**, **flexibility**, and **separation of concerns**.

---

### **Understanding Render Props with an Example**

Let's break it down with an example.

#### **Example: A Mouse Tracker Component**

Suppose we need a component that tracks the user's mouse position and displays it dynamically. Instead of tightly coupling this logic to one specific UI, we can make it reusable using a **render prop**.

##### **Step 1: Create a Mouse Tracker Component**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const MouseTracker = (props) => {
  const [mouse, setMouse] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
    setMouse({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ height: "100vh" }} onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>
      {props.render(mouse)}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MouseTracker;
```

#### **Step 2: Use the MouseTracker Component**

Now, we can use `MouseTracker` and pass a function (render prop) that determines what to render.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import MouseTracker from "./MouseTracker";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MouseTracker
      render={(mouse) => (
        <h1>
          Mouse position: ({mouse.x}, {mouse.y})
        </h1>
      )}
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```

### **How It Works**

1. The `MouseTracker` component manages the **mouse position state**.
2. It **calls** the `props.render` function, passing the current mouse position as an argument.
3. The `App` component **provides** a function that takes `mouse` coordinates and renders an `<h1>` element displaying them.

This technique **decouples the logic from the UI**, making it easy to reuse the logic in different ways.

### **Why Use Render Props?**

Render props are useful when:
✅ You need **code reuse** between components.  
✅ You want to **separate concerns** (logic vs. UI).  
✅ You need **flexibility** in rendering UI.

---

### **Alternative Approaches**

While render props are powerful, modern React often prefers **Hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, custom hooks)** for similar use cases. The **same example using a custom hook** would look like this:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const useMousePosition = () => {
  const [mouse, setMouse] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
      setMouse({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
    };

    window.addEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
  }, []);

  return mouse;
};

const App = () => {
  const mouse = useMousePosition();

  return (
    <h1>
      Mouse position: ({mouse.x}, {mouse.y})
    </h1>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### **Conclusion**

- **Render Props** help in reusing logic and keeping components flexible.
- **Hooks** (introduced in React 16.8) provide a more modern alternative.
