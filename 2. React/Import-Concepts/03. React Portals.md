# React Portals :

**React Portals** provide a way to render a component's children into a DOM node that exists outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy. This is useful when you need to break out of the current DOM structure, such as when creating modals, tooltips, dropdowns, or other UI elements that need to be visually detached from their parent component.

---

### Why Use Portals?

1. **Breaking Out of the DOM Hierarchy**:

   - By default, React components render their children into the nearest parent DOM node. Portals allow you to render children into a different part of the DOM, even outside the root React component.

2. **Visual and Logical Separation**:

   - Portals are useful for UI elements that need to visually "pop out" of their parent container, such as modals or tooltips, while still maintaining a logical connection to the parent component in the React tree.

3. **Avoiding CSS Issues**:

   - Rendering elements like modals outside the main DOM hierarchy helps avoid issues with CSS stacking context, `z-index`, or overflow constraints.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Portals can improve accessibility by ensuring that elements like modals are rendered in a way that screen readers can properly interpret.

### How Portals Work:

Portals use the `ReactDOM.createPortal` API to render children into a specified DOM node. The syntax is:

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(children, domNode);
```

- `children`: The React elements or components you want to render.
- `domNode`: The DOM node (outside the current React tree) where the children should be rendered.

### Example: Creating a Modal with Portals

Hereâ€™s an example of using a portal to render a modal dialog:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function Modal({ children }) {
  // Create a portal to render the modal outside the root DOM node
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    <div
      style={{
        position: "fixed",
        top: "0",
        left: "0",
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
        backgroundColor: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          backgroundColor: "white",
          padding: "20px",
          borderRadius: "10px",
        }}
      >
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>,
    document.getElementById("modal-root") // Render into a DOM node outside the root
  );
}

function App() {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setShowModal(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      {showModal && (
        <Modal>
          <h2>Modal Title</h2>
          <p>This is a modal dialog.</p>
          <button onClick={() => setShowModal(false)}>Close</button>
        </Modal>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- In this example:
  - The `Modal` component uses `ReactDOM.createPortal` to render its content into a DOM node with the ID `modal-root`.
  - The `modal-root` node is defined outside the root React component in the HTML file:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<div id="modal-root"></div>
```

### Key Features of Portals:

1. **Event Bubbling**:

   - Even though the portal renders outside the parent DOM node, events still bubble up through the React component hierarchy. For example, if you click inside the modal, the event will propagate to the parent component in the React tree.

2. **Logical Connection**:

   - Portals maintain a logical connection to the parent component in the React tree, even though they are rendered in a different part of the DOM.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Portals can be used for any scenario where you need to render content outside the current DOM hierarchy, such as tooltips, dropdowns, or popovers.

---

### When to Use Portals:

- **Modals and Dialogs**: Render modals outside the main DOM hierarchy to avoid CSS conflicts and ensure proper stacking.
- **Tooltips and Popovers**: Render tooltips or popovers outside their parent container to avoid overflow issues.
- **Dropdowns**: Render dropdown menus outside their parent container to ensure they are not clipped by overflow constraints.
- **Global UI Elements**: Render global UI elements like notifications or loading spinners outside the main DOM hierarchy.

---

### Limitations of Portals:

1. **Accessibility**:

   - While portals can improve accessibility, you need to ensure that the portal content is properly managed for screen readers (e.g., using ARIA attributes).

2. **Complexity**:

   - Using portals adds some complexity to your app, as you need to manage the DOM nodes and ensure they are properly cleaned up.

3. **Performance**:
   - Overusing portals can lead to performance issues, especially if you create many portal nodes.

### Conclusion:

React Portals are a powerful tool for rendering components outside their parent DOM hierarchy. They are particularly useful for creating modals, tooltips, and other UI elements that need to visually "pop out" of their container. By using portals, you can maintain a clean and logical component structure while avoiding common CSS and DOM issues.
