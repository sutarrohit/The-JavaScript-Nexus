## 🧩 **Introduction**

**Data Query Language (DQL)** is a subset of **SQL (Structured Query Language)** used to **retrieve and view data** stored in database tables.
It focuses **only on querying** (reading) data — without altering or deleting it.

DQL is the most frequently used part of SQL because almost every database operation involves **fetching data for display, reporting, or analysis**.

## 🎯 **Purpose**

-   To **retrieve data** from the database.
-   To **analyze, filter, and display** information stored in one or more tables.
-   To **combine data** from multiple tables using joins and subqueries.

## 🧱 **Main DQL Command**

### 🟩 **SELECT – Retrieve Data**

The `SELECT` statement is the **only** command in DQL.
It retrieves specific data from one or more tables based on given conditions.

### 🧾 **Basic Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition;
```

Each part of the query serves a specific function:

| Clause       | Function                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **SELECT**   | Specifies the columns to retrieve                 |
| **FROM**     | Specifies the table(s) to query                   |
| **WHERE**    | Filters rows based on a condition                 |
| **ORDER BY** | Sorts the output in ascending or descending order |
| **GROUP BY** | Groups rows for aggregate calculations            |
| **HAVING**   | Filters groups based on aggregate conditions      |

## 🧠 **Examples**

### 1️⃣ **Retrieve Specific Columns**

```sql
SELECT name, department FROM employees;
```

📍 _Fetches only the `name` and `department` columns from the `employees` table._

### 2️⃣ **Retrieve with Condition**

```sql
SELECT name, department FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

📍 _Retrieves names and departments of employees whose salary is greater than 50,000._

### 3️⃣ **Sort the Results**

```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

📍 _Displays employee names and salaries, sorted from highest to lowest salary._

### 4️⃣ **Aggregate Data**

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

📍 _Shows the average salary for each department._

### 5️⃣ **Filter Groups (Using HAVING)**

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

📍 _Displays departments with more than 5 employees._

### 6️⃣ **Using Aliases for Readability**

```sql
SELECT name AS EmployeeName, salary AS MonthlyPay
FROM employees;
```

📍 _Uses aliases to rename columns in the result set._

### 7️⃣ **Retrieve All Columns**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

📍 _Retrieves all columns from the `employees` table._

## ⚖️ **Difference Between DQL and DML**

| Basis                   | DQL (Data Query Language)      | DML (Data Manipulation Language) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**             | Retrieve (read) data           | Insert, update, or delete data   |
| **Command Used**        | SELECT                         | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE           |
| **Effect on Data**      | Does not change data           | Modifies data                    |
| **Transaction Control** | No need for commit or rollback | Requires commit or rollback      |
| **Operation Type**      | Read-only                      | Read and write                   |
