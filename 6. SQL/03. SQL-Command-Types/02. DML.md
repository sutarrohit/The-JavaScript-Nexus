# 📘 **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

**Data Manipulation Language (DML)** is a subset of **SQL (Structured Query Language)** used to **manipulate and manage data** stored inside database tables.
While **DDL (Data Definition Language)** defines the structure of a database (like creating or modifying tables), **DML** focuses on **working with the actual data** — inserting, updating, and deleting records.

These commands are fundamental for **day-to-day database operations**, ensuring that stored information remains **accurate, updated, and relevant**.

## ⚙️ **Key Characteristics of DML**

| Feature                 | Description                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**             | To manipulate the data inside database tables                         |
| **Effect**              | Operates on the content of tables (rows), not their structure         |
| **Transaction Control** | DML statements can be rolled back or committed (`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) |
| **Usage Frequency**     | Used very frequently in daily database operations                     |
| **Auto-Commit**         | Not auto-committed (changes can be undone before committing)          |
| **Affects**             | Only the **data**, not the **schema**                                 |

## 🧱 **Main DML Commands**

DML includes the following major commands:

1. **INSERT** – Adds new data (records) into a table
2. **UPDATE** – Modifies existing data within a table
3. **DELETE** – Removes existing data from a table

---

### 1️⃣ **INSERT – Add Data**

The `INSERT` command is used to **add one or more new records** into a table.

#### 🧾 **Syntax:**

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

#### 🧠 **Examples:**

```sql
-- Insert a single record
INSERT INTO Student (student_id, name, age, course)
VALUES (101, 'Rohit', 21, 'Computer Science');

-- Insert multiple records
INSERT INTO Student (student_id, name, age, course)
VALUES
(102, 'Priya', 22, 'Mathematics'),
(103, 'Arjun', 20, 'Physics');
```

📍 _The `INSERT` statement adds data to the table but doesn’t change the structure._

---

### 2️⃣ **UPDATE – Modify Data**

The `UPDATE` command is used to **change existing data** in a table.
You can update specific rows using the `WHERE` clause or all rows if no condition is provided.

#### 🧾 **Syntax:**

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

#### 🧠 **Examples:**

```sql
-- Update one record
UPDATE Student
SET age = 22
WHERE student_id = 101;

-- Update multiple records
UPDATE Student
SET course = 'Data Science'
WHERE course = 'Computer Science';
```

⚠️ **Important:**
If you omit the `WHERE` clause, _all rows_ in the table will be updated — use it carefully.

---

### 3️⃣ **DELETE – Remove Data**

The `DELETE` command is used to **remove existing records** from a table.
It only deletes the data — the table structure remains unchanged.

#### 🧾 **Syntax:**

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### 🧠 **Examples:**

```sql
-- Delete a specific record
DELETE FROM Student
WHERE student_id = 103;

-- Delete all records
DELETE FROM Student;
```

📍 _If no `WHERE` clause is used, the entire table’s data is deleted but the table structure still exists._

## ⚖️ **Difference Between DELETE and TRUNCATE**

| Feature          | DELETE                      | TRUNCATE                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Type**         | DML                         | DDL                        |
| **Removes**      | Specific or all rows        | All rows only              |
| **WHERE Clause** | Allowed                     | Not allowed                |
| **Rollback**     | Possible                    | Not possible (auto-commit) |
| **Speed**        | Slower (logs each deletion) | Faster (no logging)        |

---

## 🔒 **Transactions in DML**

DML operations are **transactional**, meaning they can be controlled using SQL transaction commands:

-   `COMMIT` → To permanently save changes
-   `ROLLBACK` → To undo changes made since the last commit

#### 🧠 **Example:**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Student
SET age = 23
WHERE student_id = 102;

-- If the update is correct
COMMIT;

-- If an error occurred
ROLLBACK;
```

📍 _Transactions ensure **data integrity** and allow for safe recovery from mistakes._

## 🧠 **Difference Between DDL and DML**

| Basis           | DDL (Data Definition Language)                    | DML (Data Manipulation Language)   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Defines and manages the structure of the database | Manipulates the data within tables |
| **Examples**    | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE                     | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE             |
| **Affects**     | Schema (database structure)                       | Table data (records)               |
| **Auto-Commit** | Yes                                               | No (manual COMMIT required)        |
| **Rollback**    | Not possible                                      | Possible                           |
| **Use Case**    | Database setup and modification                   | Daily data operations              |

## 🔍 **Example — Complete DML Workflow**

```sql
-- 1️⃣ Insert new records
INSERT INTO Student (student_id, name, age, course)
VALUES (101, 'Rohit', 21, 'Computer Science');

-- 2️⃣ Update an existing record
UPDATE Student
SET course = 'Data Science'
WHERE student_id = 101;

-- 3️⃣ Delete a record
DELETE FROM Student
WHERE student_id = 101;
```

📍 _These three commands together handle the entire data lifecycle inside a table._

## ✅ **Summary Table**

| Command    | Operation | Description                          |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **INSERT** | Add       | Adds new rows of data into a table   |
| **UPDATE** | Modify    | Changes existing data within a table |
| **DELETE** | Remove    | Removes existing data from a table   |

## 💡 **Real-World Use Cases**

-   Adding new customer orders or transactions (`INSERT`)
-   Correcting errors or updating product information (`UPDATE`)
-   Removing inactive users or outdated records (`DELETE`)
-   Performing data cleanup during maintenance operations
-   Managing application user actions that alter database content
