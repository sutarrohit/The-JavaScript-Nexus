# 🧩 **What Are Relational Databases?**

A **relational database** is a kind of **database management system (DBMS)** that organizes data into **tables (also called relations)** — much like spreadsheets — where **each row represents a record**, and **each column represents a field or attribute** of that record.

They are based on the **Relational Model**, introduced by **E.F. Codd** in 1970.

### ⚙️ **Core Structure**

Each table has:

-   **Rows (Records)** — individual entries of data
-   **Columns (Fields)** — specific properties of that data

For example, a simple database for students:

| student_id | name  | age | course_id |
| ---------- | ----- | --- | --------- |
| 1          | Alice | 20  | 101       |
| 2          | Bob   | 22  | 102       |

### 🔑 **Relationships Between Tables**

The “relational” part means that **tables can be related** to one another through **keys**:

-   **Primary Key** — a unique identifier for each record in a table (e.g., `student_id`)
-   **Foreign Key** — a field that links one table to another (e.g., `course_id` in the student table links to a `course` table)

This allows you to **join data** from multiple tables efficiently.

Example:

| course_id | course_name      |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| 101       | Database Systems |
| 102       | Web Development  |

You can easily get a list of all students and their courses by joining the `students` and `courses` tables.

### 🧮 **Key Features**

1. **Use of SQL (Structured Query Language)**

    - SQL is used to **query, insert, update, and delete** data.
    - Example:

        ```sql
        SELECT name FROM students WHERE age > 20;
        ```

2. **Support for ACID Transactions**

    - Ensures data reliability and integrity even in case of failures.

        - **Atomicity:** All or nothing — each transaction completes fully or not at all.
        - **Consistency:** Database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.
        - **Isolation:** Transactions don’t interfere with each other.
        - **Durability:** Once committed, data stays saved even after crashes.

3. **Data Integrity through Constraints**

    - Rules that ensure the correctness of data.
    - Examples:

        - `PRIMARY KEY` → unique and not null
        - `FOREIGN KEY` → must match a record in another table
        - `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`, etc.

4. **Complex Queries and Relationships**

    - You can perform advanced queries across multiple tables using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, etc.

5. **Scalability and Multi-user Support**

    - Many users can read/write simultaneously.
    - Databases handle concurrency with transactions and locks.

### 💡 **Examples of Relational Databases**

-   **MySQL** – Popular open-source RDBMS
-   **PostgreSQL** – Advanced, open-source, standards-compliant
-   **Oracle Database** – Enterprise-grade, highly scalable
-   **Microsoft SQL Server** – Microsoft’s enterprise RDBMS
