## **Structured Query Language (SQL)**

**Definition:**
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a _standard language_ used to manage and interact with relational databases.
It is known as a **hybrid language** because it combines several types of sub-languages, each with a specific purpose — to **define, manipulate, query, and control** data and database structures.

---

## 1️⃣ **Data Definition Language (DDL)**

**Purpose:**
Used to **define, modify, and manage** the _structure_ of a database, such as creating or altering tables, schemas, and indexes.

**Main focus:**
DDL deals with the **database schema** (the blueprint or structure of the database), not the data itself.

**Key Features:**

-   Defines and manages database objects (tables, views, schemas, indexes, etc.)
-   Automatically commits changes (cannot be rolled back easily)
-   Works at the schema level, affecting how data is stored and organized

**Common Commands:**

-   `CREATE` – to create new database objects
-   `ALTER` – to modify the structure of existing objects
-   `DROP` – to delete existing database objects
-   `TRUNCATE` – to remove all records from a table but retain its structure

**Examples:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  department VARCHAR(50),
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN joining_date DATE;
DROP TABLE employees;
```

**Explanation:**
These commands respectively **create**, **alter**, and **drop** a table named `employees`.

## 2️⃣ **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

**Purpose:**
Used to **insert, modify, and delete** data that exists inside database tables.

**Main focus:**
DML focuses on **data operations** — the actual records stored in tables.

**Key Features:**

-   Manipulates data without altering the table structure.
-   Supports **transactions** (can be committed or rolled back).
-   Commonly used in daily database operations like adding or editing records.

**Common Commands:**

-   `INSERT` – adds new data into a table
-   `UPDATE` – modifies existing data
-   `DELETE` – removes data from a table

**Examples:**

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, salary)
VALUES (1, 'Rohit', 'IT', 60000);

UPDATE employees SET salary = 65000 WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
```

**Explanation:**
These statements **insert**, **update**, and **delete** employee records.

## 3️⃣ **Data Query Language (DQL)**

**Purpose:**
Used to **retrieve data** from the database.

**Main focus:**
To extract and display data stored in tables, without modifying it.

**Key Features:**

-   Only retrieves data; it does not change the database.
-   Involves **filtering**, **sorting**, and **aggregating** results using conditions.
-   Mainly uses the `SELECT` statement.

**Common Command:**

-   `SELECT` – retrieves data from one or more tables.

**Examples:**

```sql
SELECT name, department FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

**Explanation:**
This query fetches the names and departments of employees whose salary is greater than 50,000.

## 4️⃣ **Data Control Language (DCL)**

**Purpose:**
Used to **control access, privileges, and permissions** to the data stored in a database.

**Main focus:**
DCL ensures **database security and access control**, determining who can do what.

**Key Features:**

-   Grants or revokes privileges to users.
-   Helps maintain data security and privacy.
-   Usually executed by **database administrators (DBAs)**.

**Common Commands:**

-   `GRANT` – provides specific privileges to users
-   `REVOKE` – removes given privileges from users

**Examples:**

```sql
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON employees TO user1;
REVOKE UPDATE ON employees FROM user1;
```

**Explanation:**
The first command gives `user1` permission to select and update data in the `employees` table,
and the second command removes their update permission.
