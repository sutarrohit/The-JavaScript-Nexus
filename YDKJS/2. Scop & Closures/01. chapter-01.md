## ✅ Is JavaScript Interpreted or Compiled?

JavaScript is **both interpreted and compiled**, depending on the engine and context.

-   **Historically**: Interpreted.
-   **Modern Engines (like V8)**: Use **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation for speed.

### ⚙️ How JavaScript Runs in Modern Engines (e.g. V8)

#### 1. **Parsing Phase**

-   JavaScript source code is parsed into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
-   This step analyzes the syntax but does **not interpret or execute** the code yet.

#### 2. **Interpretation: Bytecode Generation & Execution**

-   The AST is sent to the **Ignition interpreter**.
-   Ignition compiles it into **bytecode** (a simplified low-level representation).
-   The **bytecode is interpreted line-by-line and executed**.

✅ **This is the actual "interpretation" phase** in modern engines.

> 🔍 Example:
> A function like `add(a, b) { return a + b; }` becomes bytecode instructions such as `LdaNamedProperty`, `Add`, `Return`, which the interpreter executes.

#### 3. **JIT Compilation for Performance**

-   If the interpreter sees a function being run **frequently**, it marks it as **"hot."**
-   The function is sent to **TurboFan (JIT compiler)**.
-   It is compiled into **machine code** (native CPU instructions) for faster execution.

## 🔁 Execution Flow in Modern Engines

```
JavaScript Source Code
     ↓
   Parser → AST
     ↓
Interpreter (Ignition) → Bytecode (interpreted)
     ↓ (if hot code)
 JIT Compiler (TurboFan) → Machine Code (compiled)
```

## 📝 Chapter 1: What Is Scope

### 🔑 1. **What is Scope?**

-   Scope is **how JavaScript keeps track of variables** and controls **where you can access them**.
-   When you declare a variable (e.g. `var x = 10`), scope determines **where in the program that `x` can be used**.
-   Without scope, variables would all live in one global space — causing **name clashes and bugs**.

### ⚙️ 2. **How Scope Works (Compiler Theory)**

-   Even though JavaScript is interpreted, it still **compiles your code before execution**.
-   That compilation process involves:

    1. **Lexing**: Turning characters into tokens
    2. **Parsing**: Creating a syntax tree (AST)
    3. **Code Generation**: Preparing executable code

💡 During this compilation, the engine decides **where variables live**, and that’s what sets up the scope.

---

### 👷 3. **Who’s Involved in Scope?**

Imagine a team working together:

-   **Engine**: Runs the JavaScript
-   **Compiler**: Prepares the code and declares variables
-   **Scope**: Keeps track of all variables in the current block/function

Each time a variable is seen, the **compiler asks the scope if it already exists or needs to be created**.

---

### ➗ 4. **LHS vs RHS Lookups (Very Important!)**

JavaScript distinguishes two types of variable lookups:

-   **LHS (Left-Hand Side)**: When a variable is on the **left side of an assignment**

    -   e.g. `x = 10;` — we’re trying to **assign** to `x`

-   **RHS (Right-Hand Side)**: When a variable is **used or accessed** for its value

    -   e.g. `console.log(x);` — we’re trying to **read** the value of `x`

📌 Why this matters:

-   JavaScript uses **different behavior** if an LHS variable is not found — it might even **create a new one**, unless in strict mode.
-   RHS lookups, if not found, always throw an error.

---

### 🪜 5. **Nested Scope (Scope Inside Scope)**

-   Functions (and some blocks) **create inner scopes**, nested inside outer scopes.
-   When the engine tries to find a variable, it starts in the **current scope** and moves outward **one level at a time**, until it finds it or reaches global scope.

📌 Example:

```js
function outer() {
    var a = 1;
    function inner() {
        console.log(a); // inner can access outer's variables
    }
    inner();
}
```

---

### ❗ 6. **Scope Errors**

#### ReferenceError:

-   Happens when a variable is **not found during RHS lookup**

```js
console.log(foo); // ReferenceError if foo isn't declared
```

#### TypeError:

-   Happens when a variable **exists** but you try to use it in the **wrong way**

```js
var foo = 42;
foo(); // TypeError: foo is not a function
```

#### LHS in Non-Strict Mode:

-   If you use a variable without declaring it in **non-strict mode**, JavaScript will **implicitly create a global variable** — which is dangerous and error-prone.

```js
function test() {
    x = 10; // creates a global `x` if not in strict mode
}
```

### 📋 7. Quiz Summary from Book

```js
function foo(a) {
    var b = a;
    return a + b;
}
var c = foo(2);
```

**LHS Lookups (3)**:

-   `a = 2` (parameter assignment)
-   `b = a` (assignment to b)
-   `c = foo(2)` (assignment to c)

**RHS Lookups (4)**:

-   `foo(2)` (calling foo)
-   `a` (to assign to b)
-   `a + b` (both are RHS to add values)

---

### ✅ Final Review Summary

-   Scope defines **where variables live** and **how they're found**.
-   JavaScript uses **lexical scope** — which means scope is decided **based on where you write your code**, not how it runs.
-   The **difference between LHS and RHS** is essential for understanding how assignments and errors work.
-   Nested scopes allow inner functions to access outer variables, but **not the other way around**.
-   Mistakes in scope often result in `ReferenceError` or accidental global variables — especially in non-strict mode.
