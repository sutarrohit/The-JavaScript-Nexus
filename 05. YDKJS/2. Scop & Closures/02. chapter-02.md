## 📝 Chapter 2 - Lexical Scope

### Scope :

Scope collect and maintains a look-up list of the all the declared identifiers (variables) and enforces a strict set of rules as to how theses are accessible to currently executing code .

### Lexical Scope :

**Lexical scope** means that the scope of variables is determined by their physical placement in the source code that is, where variables and blocks are _written_ (i.e. at "lex" or _lexing time_, during compilation). It is **set at author-time**, and nested according to the structure of the code.

This means:

-   Where a function is declared determines what variables it has access to.
-   Lexical scope is resolved _statically_, not dynamically — meaning, it's not based on how or from where a function is called, but where it is **defined**.

-   Lexical scope defined at the time the code is written (lexing time)

> 💡 Think of lexical scope as "scope bubbles" nested inside one another based on code structure.

#### 1. **Lex-time Scoping**

-   Lexical scope is defined at _lexing time_ (compilation).
-   The structure of nested functions and blocks determines how variables are accessible.

#### 2. **Nested Scope Bubbles**

-   Each function creates a new scope.
-   Variables are accessible in their own scope and any inner scopes.
-   Lookups start from the current scope and go outward (upward in the nested structure) until found.

#### 3. **Shadowing**

-   Inner variables can have the same name as outer variables.
-   Inner variables **shadow** outer ones — i.e., the outer variable is not accessible within that inner scope.

#### 4. **Cheating Lexical Scope (Don’t Do This!)**

-   JavaScript provides two mechanisms to override lexical scope dynamically:

    -   `eval()`: Executes code from a string and can add variables to the current scope.
    -   `with`: Treats an object as a scope — can create confusing and unpredictable behavior.

-   **Both are discouraged** because:

    -   They break the predictability of lexical scope.
    -   They prevent performance optimizations in JS engines.

#### 5. **Performance Implications**

-   Using `eval` or `with` disables scope-related optimizations.
-   Always prefer static, author-time scoping.

#### 6. **Best Practices**

-   Avoid `eval()` and `with`.
-   Embrace lexical scope by structuring your functions cleanly and predictably.
