## JavaScript

JavaScript is a powerful, flexible language that powers the modern web. In this section, you'll find:

- **Overview**: Basics of JavaScript, syntax, data types, and operators.
- **Key Concepts**: Deep dives into important topics like objects, arrays, functions, and events.
- **Advanced Topics**: Asynchronous programming, closures, scope, and more.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making it easier to catch errors during development. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll learn:

- **Introduction to TypeScript**: Why use TypeScript, its benefits, and setting up a TypeScript project.
- **Type System**: Understanding types, interfaces, unions, tuples, and generics.
- **Advanced TypeScript Features**: Utility types, type inference, mapped types, and working with third-party libraries.

## Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. Here's what you'll learn:

- **Introduction**: What Node.js is, its architecture, and how it differs from traditional server-side languages.
- **Core Modules**: Explore built-in modules like `fs`, `http`, `path`, and more.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Understand callbacks, promises, and async/await in Node.js.
- **Working with the File System**: Learn how to read, write, and manipulate files in Node.js.

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this section, you'll explore:

- **Getting Started**: Introduction to React, JSX syntax, and the basic structure of React apps.
- **Components & State Management**: Learn about class and functional components, state, and props.
- **React Hooks**: Discover the power of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks.
- **Advanced React Patterns**: Dive deeper into context API, render props, higher-order components, and more.
